What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

    manually maybe annoy sometime, expecially when I forget it, but antomatically saved 
    still have their own problems such as when I don't want to save, I don't understand it
    when I look back.
